# Hello!
---
These are crude modules I use for building prototypes. I do not claim that these modules are optimized for any particular use whatsoever. I write a small testbench for units I personally use and check the results in the Vivado® Design Suite.

# Contents
---
All modules are described in their respective files/folders. If a testbench is supplied in a module's source code file, there may be an appropriate sim_src directory containing wave configuration and any other things that might be helpful.
 
- XIYO: contains PISO modules for parallel data serialization and a SIPO module for parallelizing serial input
